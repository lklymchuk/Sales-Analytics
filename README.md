# Sales Analytics SQL Project

This repository contains SQL queries I wrote to analyze sales, user engagement, and email marketing data.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Analysis of email sending activity per account and month.
- Calculation of session engagement rates by device type.
- Revenue and user registration metrics broken down by continent.
- Combined account and email metrics with country ranking.

## How I Used It

- Worked with large datasets joining sessions, accounts, emails, and orders.
- Applied window functions and aggregation to extract meaningful insights.
- Structured complex queries with CTEs for clarity and modularity.

## Technologies

- SQL (BigQuery / Standard SQL syntax)

## About Me

I am developing skills in data analytics and enjoy working with real datasets to solve business questions.
